# Paint
A little program trying to implement an MS Windows Paint with some simple functions made in C# ! 
Head into the Paint folder and then into bin/debug/Paint.exe to run the program and make sure you've downloaded all the files because if not, an exception will rise.

It utilizes simple commands of C# in order to let you draw into the screen, effectively imitating the Windows Paint.
